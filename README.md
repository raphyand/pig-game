### General Synopsis:
Pig 

Pig is a die game that allows for 2 to 4 players.  The goal of the game is to reach up to 100 points by rolling the die
and deciding to either continue to roll for your turn, or hold your turn, where you stop rolling and add the score you've accumulated
that turn.  If you roll a 1, then you lose your turn, and all points accumulated that turn are lost.  You then pass it to the next player.

### General Synopsis:
Pig 

Pig is a die game that allows for 2 to 4 players.  The goal of the game is to reach up to 100 points by rolling the die
and deciding to either continue to roll for your turn, or hold your turn, where you stop rolling and add the score you've accumulated
that turn.  If you roll a 1, then you lose your turn, and all points accumulated that turn are lost.  You then pass it to the next player.

Either take the risk with a hot rolling streak, or be reserved and roll as much as you need to, to maintain a steady pace.
Either way, the winner must reach 100!

### Rules:
1. Roll a die to see who goes first, ascending-order-wise
2. Roll until you like the score you currently have.
3. Hold to keep the score and add it to your total score.
4. Pass the die to the next player.
5. If you roll a 1, you lose all your current turn's accumulated score and must pass the die.
6. The first to 100 wins.


### Example:
Bojack and Mr.Peanutbutter are playing a game.  They roll a die, and Bojack receives a 1, Mr. Peanutbutter a 3.
Bojack goes first.
Bojack rolls a 6, 5, 6, and 4.  His current score is 21.
Bojack holds.
Mr.Peanutbutter's turn.
Mr.Peanutbutter rolls a 3, 3, and 5.  His current score is 11. 
Mr.Peanutbutter rolls a 1.  He loses his points, and his total score is still zero.
Mr.Peanutbutter passes the die to Bojack, and the game continues.

Near the end, Bojack and Mr.Peanutbutter are at whopping scores of 94 to 88, respectively.
Bojack rolls a 5, then a 1.
Bojack passes the die to Mr.Peanutbutter.
Mr.Peanutbutter rolls a 3, 5, 2, and 2.
Mr.Peanutbutter scores a 12, then holds.
Mr.Peanutbutter has reached 100, and he wins!
Bojack is disappointed.
